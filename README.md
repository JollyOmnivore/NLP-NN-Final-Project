This Repo contains my final for both 397 and 497 which are Natural lnaguage processing and Neural networks respectively

This repo contains everything you need in order to train and use the GUI in order to conduct reasearch on next word predictions using LSTM

Set up steps:

#1 Downloads:
    NLP&NN Final Code Train&GUI.py
    WikiQACorpus directory 

#2 esure that you have the WikiQACorpus directory on the same level in the folder as NLP&NN Final Code Train&GUI.py

#3 before trying to run go to this page and install the pytorch cuda version that fits your set up 
https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

#4 If you are not running an "modern" Nvidia GPU you must comment out the section in NLP&NN Final Code Train&GUI.py that says:
    torch.set_default_device('cuda')

#5 Ensure you have the other necessary modules 

Your good to go!
